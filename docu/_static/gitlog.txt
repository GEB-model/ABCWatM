* | | 2018-12-17 - CWatM : New: Added Python source code: Further test required, but it seems to work. -> Plan in 2019 further development will use Python 3.7 coding New: Building a executable .exe with Python 3  seems to work as well. Further testing -> 2019 an installation setup will be produced using cx_freeze and Inno setup to make an easy start on Windows (no Python background will be required for CWATM users)

Check timing, check output variables chk: a lot more error messages are given out if something is wrong chk: output netcdf time is calculate in advanced in order to reduce size of output netcdf -> data_handling line 789 sets it to this value

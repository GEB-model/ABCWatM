Water Futures and Solutions Initiatives (WFAS)
----------------------------------------------

`Water Futures and Solutions Initiatives <http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/water-futures.html>`_ is using a multi-model approach for global climatic, hydro-socioeconomic modeling in order to assess possible futures.
We use three leading global hydrological models H08, WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB for estimating water demand and supply. 
This approach is used for a better understanding of the uncertainty and limitations of modeling. 
It provides a degree of confidence in the results an is in-line with the `ISI-MIPS <https://www.isimip.org/>`_ approach of multi-modeling

Nexus Integration - Water Energy Food Environment
-------------------------------------------------

| In the framework of the `Integrated Solution project <http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchProjects/Nexus_Solutions.html>`_ 
| the Community Water Model (CWATM) will be coupled with the existing IIASA models `MESSAGE <http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/modelsData/MESSAGE/MESSAGE.en.html>`_ and `GLOBIOM <http://www.globiom.org/>`_
| in order to do enhanced water assessments and an improved analysis feedback on water, energy, food and environmental aspects

CWAT and the IIASA global hydro-economic model
----------------------------------------------

The Community Water Model will help to develop a next-generation hydro-economic modeling tool that represents the economic trade-offs among water supply technologies and demands. The tool will track water use from all sectors and will identify the least-cost solutions for meeting future water demands under policy constraints.  In addition, the tool will track the energy requirements associated with the water supply system (e.g., desalination and water conveyance) to facilitate the linkage with the energy-economic tool. The tool will also incorporate environmental flow requirements to ensure sufficient water for environmental needs. The new hydro-economic model will be linked to CWATM by GAMS output and input files (gdx-files).








Features of the Model
=====================

Community Model
---------------


.. csv-table:: 
   :header: "Feature", "Description"
   :widths: 40, 50 

   "Community driven","Open-source but lead by IIASA `GitHub repository <https://github.com/CWatM>`_"
   "Well documented","Documentation, automatic source code documentation `GitHub Docu <https://cwatm.github.io>`_"
   "Easy handling","Use of a setting file with all necessary information for the user  :ref:`rst_setting` and  :ref:`rst_metadata`"
   "Multi-platform","Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix - to be used on different platforms (PC, clusters, super-computers)"
   "Modular","Processes in subprograms, easy to adapt to the requirements of options/ solutions `Modular structure <https://github.com/CWatM/CWatM/tree/branch2/source/hydrological_modules>`_"


Water Model
-----------


.. csv-table::
   :header: "Feature", "Description"
   :widths: 40, 50 

   "Flexible","different resolution, different processes for different needs, links to other models, across sectors and across scales"
   "Adjustable","to be tailored to the needs at IIASA i.e. collaboration with other programs/models, including solutions and option as part of the model"
   "Multi-disciplinary","including economics, environmental needs, social science perspectives"
   "Sensitive","Sensitive to option / solution"
   "Fast","Global to regional modeling – a mixture between conceptional and physical modeling – as complex as necessary but not more"
   "Comparable","Part of the ISI-MIP community"

Model design and processes
==========================

Design
------

The Community Water Model (CWATM) will be designed for the purpose to assess water availability, water demand and environmental needs. It includes an accounting of how future water demands will evolve in response to socioeconomic change and how water availability will change in response to climate.

Processes
---------

Calculation of potential Evaporation
************************************

Using Penman-Montheith equations based on FAO 56

Calculation of rain, snow, snowmelt
***********************************

Using day-degree approach with up to 10 vertical layers
Including snow- and glacier melt.

Land cover
**********

using fraction of 6 different land cover types

* Forest
* Grassland
* Irrigated land
* Paddy irrigated land
* Sealed areas (urban)
* Water

Water demand
************

* including water demand from industry and domestic land use via precalculated monhly spatial maps
* including agricultural water use from calculation of plant water demand
* Return flows

Vegetation
**********

Vegetation taken into account for calculating

* Albedo
* Transpiration
* Interception

Soil
****

Three soil layers for each land cover type including processes:

* Frost interupting soil processes
* Infiltration
* Preferential flow
* Capillary rise
* Surface runoff
* Interflow
* Percolation into groundwater

Groundwater
***********

Groundwater storage is simulated as linear groundwater reservoir

Lakes & Reservoirs
******************

Lakes are simulated with the weir function
Reservoirs are simulated  as outflow function between three storage limits (conservative, normal,flood) and three outflow functions (minimum, normal, non-damaging)

Routing
*******

Routing is calculated using the kinematic wave approach

What you need
=============

Python 2.7.x 64 bit and a running CWATM (libraries netCDF4, numpy, scipy, GDAL)
In addition: **library deap**

Calibration is using a distributed evolutionary algorithms in python: DEAP library

Félix-Antoine Fortin, François-Michel De Rainville, Marc-André Gardner, Marc Parizeau and Christian Gagné, "DEAP: Evolutionary Algorithms Made Easy", Journal of Machine Learning Research, vol. 13, pp. 2171-2175


.. note::
     Deap can also be used in Python 3.7 but at the moment we did not translate the scripts to Python3.7. it is on the TODO list

You can install it with: 
Pip install deap (you might change into the folder ../python/Scripts/)

*	Make sure that python 2.7.x is working
*	Make sure that CWATM is running in non calibration mode
*	For some of the following steps it is easier to have PCRaster installed: http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/


Running calibration
===================

1. Look into the settings file of the calibration folder. 

2. look into runCalibration.bat. If python is in your computer path everything should be ok, otherwise put in the path to python

3. look into templates/runpy.bat. Put the path to python in if necessary

4. look into templates/settings.ini. Put the pathes in a right way that it fits to your computer::

    [FILE_PATHS]
    #-------------------------------------------------------
    PathRoot = P:/watmodel/CWATM/calibration_tutorial
    PathOut = $(PathRoot)/output
    PathMaps = $(PathRoot)/CWATM_data/cwatm_input
    PathMeteo = $(PathRoot)/climate

5. in observed_data/yukon2001.cvs you find the observed data::

    - make sure the name in the header is the same as in [ObservedData] Column
    - make sure that there are enough data in (from ForcingStart to ForcingEnd)

#. make sure the folder catchments is empty! Before each try this folder has to be empty


Run runCalibration.bat
======================

#. go for testing (see below)
#. go for testing again (see below)
#. Change use_multiprocessing =1 in settings.txt
#. Run runCalibration.bat and after some time something should appear on your window

For testing
===========

* Change use_multiprocessing = 0 in settings.txt
* Delete catchments but keep the empty folder
* Run runCalibration.bat and wait till catchment/00_001 gets filled, then interrupt

#. Change to catchments/00_001
#. Run runpy00_001.bat
#. See what errors come up and change settings-Run00_001.ini
#. Change template/setting.ini in the same way
#. Do this again and again till no error

Running it on your computer
===========================

It will be really slow on Windows using data on the the server – next step run it on your PC

* copy the whole folder P:\watmodel\CWATM\calibration_tutorial to your PC (only 15 GB) 
* (but maybe you have already parts of it on your computer – like the big climate input files)
* Make it work on your computer::

	Changing file paths in templates/settings.ini, setting.txt
	Changing the path for python in runCalibration.bat and templates/runpy.bat

Preparation for another catchment
=================================

Preparing the observed dataset – discharge
------------------------------------------

Calibration works by comparing simulated discharge with observed discharge using an objective function:
Here we use the Kling-Gupta Efficiency but we can also use Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency . Please find some more information on the objective function an on the evolutionary computation framework used for calibration on: https://cwatm.github.io/calibration.html

* The observed values can be stored as daily values or monthly values
* The observed values should be at least cover 5 years (best is 10-15 years)
* The observed discharge has to be stored as textfile in::

    ./observed_data/nameofstation.cvs
    And has to look like this:
    date,yukon_pilot_station
    2001-04-01,1302.6
    2001-04-02,1302.6
    2001-04-03,1302.6
    2001-04-04,1302.6
    …
    …
    2013-12-31,2647.6

* Or::    
    
    date ,zhutuo
    2002-01-01,3229.0
    2002-02-01,2979.2
    2002-03-01,3229.0

**Format:**

* Date format like this year-month-day [yyyy-mm-dd]
* Separated by a comma
* Discharge in [m3/s]
* If a value is missing that is not a problem (as long as the time series is long enough)::

    it should like this: (no value after the comma)
    2002-01-12,

* For each day (or month) a line

**Settings.txt**

In the settings file the lines::
    
    [ObservedData]
    Qtss = observed_data/zhutuo_2002month.csv
    Column = zhutuo
    Header = River: Yangtze  station: Zhutuo
    
Should correspondent to the name and header in the observed discharge.cvs

The lines::

    ForcingStart = 1/1/2002
    ForcingEnd = 31/12/2013

Should correspondent to the amount of lines in the observed discharge.cvs


Creating an initial netcdf file for warm start
==============================================

It is best to have a long warm up phase especially for groundwater:
See also: https://cwatm.github.io/setup.html#initialisation

You can run CWATM for a couple of years (20 years or more) and store the last days storage values in a file. This file can be read in to enable a ‘warm” start

* change use_multiprocessing = 0 in settings.txt
* Delete catchments but keep the empty folder
* Run runCalibration.bat and wait till catchment/00_001 gets filled, then interrupt
* Change to catchments/00_001

**Open the settings-Run_001.init**

* Change load_initial = True to load_initial = False
* save_initial = True
* initSave = $(FILE_PATHS:PathRoot)/CWATM_init/testx
* StepInit = 31/01/1996   (change it to a date 1 month after your StepStart)
* Run runpy00_001.bat

:raw-html:`&rarr;` There should be a file ./CWATM_init/testx_19960131.nc

* Change to: load_initial = True 
* initLoad =  $(FILE_PATHS:PathRoot)/CWATM_init/testx_19960131.nc
* 	Run runpy00_001.bat

:raw-html:`&rarr;`	If it work then it used the initial file you generate before (that was just a test)

**Now change to:**

* StepStart = 1/1/1961
* StepEnd =  31/12/2013
* load_initial = False
* save_initial = True
* initSave = $(FILE_PATHS:PathRoot)/CWATM_init/station_name
* StepInit = 31/12/2013
* Run runpy00_001.bat

:raw-html:`&rarr;`	This should have generated a file ./CWATM_init/station_name_20131231.nc

**And again:**

* StepStart = 1/1/1961 (some 20 years or longer)
* StepEnd =  31/12/1995 (a day before your normal running day)
* load_initial = True
* initLoad =  $(FILE_PATHS:PathRoot)/CWATM_init/station_name_20131231.nc
* save_initial = True
* initSave = $(FILE_PATHS:PathRoot)/CWATM_init/station_name
* StepInit = 31/12/1995  (a day before your running day)
* Run runpy00_001.bat

:raw-html:`&rarr;` This should have generated a file ./CWATM_init/station_name_19951231.nc

**And last part:**

* Change StepStart and StepEnd back to original values
* load_initial = True
* initLoad =  $(FILE_PATHS:PathRoot)/CWATM_init/station_name_19951231.nc
* save_initial = False
* Run runpy00_001.bat

:raw-html:`&rarr;` If it works, do the same in the ./template/settings.ini

.. note::  You have now a “warm” start for every calibration run




Cutting out a catchment as mask map
===================================

See the .doc file in 
P:\watmodel\CWATM\calibration_tutorial\calibration\tools\cut_catchment\
For a description:

**Requirements:** PCRASTER:

We do no need the python version, I think downloading, extracting and setting of the paths in 
P:\watmodel\CWATM\calibration_tutorial\calibration\tools\cut_catchment\catch\config_win.ini
Creating the 2 potential evaporation files in advance

Potential evaporation is Calculated with Penman-Monteith in CWATM, but it is not part of the calibration = there is no change in pot. Evaporation. In order to make the calibration computational faster the results of pot evaporation could be stored and used every time.

For the 30min this is done already as global map set, but for the 5min these files become too big. So they have to be produced for each basin separately

Same preparation as for **Creating an initial netcdf file for warm start**  see above
There should be a folder catchments\00_001 with a working run for 001.

**Open the settings-Run_001.init**

Change::

    [Option] calc_evaporation = True
    [TIME-RELATED_CONSTANTS] SpinUp = None
    [EVAPORATION]
    OUT_Dir = $(FILE_PATHS:PathOut)
    OUT_MAP_Daily = ETRef, EWRef

**Run runpy00_001.bat**
:raw-html:`&rarr;`	There should be a file ETRef.nc and EWRef in the output directory

Rename the files e.g. ETRef.nc to ETRef_yangtze.nc, EWRef.nc to EWRef_yangtze.nc and copy it to PathMeteo (or somewhere else, you have to put the path in)

**Open the settings-Run_001.init**

Change::

    [Option] calc_evaporation = False
    [TIME-RELATED_CONSTANTS] SpinUp = -> to the time it was before
    [Meteo]
    daily reference evaporation (free water) 
    E0Maps = $(FILE_PATHS:PathMeteo)/EWRef_yangtze
    daily reference evapotranspiration (crop) 
    ETMaps = $(FILE_PATHS:PathMeteo)/ETRef_yangtze
    [EVAPORATION]
    OUT_Dir = $(FILE_PATHS:PathOut)       !!! outcomment this again - important
    OUT_MAP_Daily = ETRef, EWRef

**Test it:**  Run runpy00_001.bat

And change the settings.ini in templates in the same way


Calibration of a downstream catchment
=====================================
Calibration of a downstream catchment (upstream catchment is already calibrated) can be done using:

* The catchment area of the downstream catchment minus the upstream catchment
* The missing discharge from the upstream catchment is replaced by an inflow file

1. Cut the mask map, so that the upstream catchment is NOT in the mask map anymore
2. Detect the point(s) downstream of the inflow points
3. Run the best calibration scenario(s) of the upstream catchments again to produce long timeserie(s) of the outlet(s) point
4. Create an inflow file from the long timeseries of outlet(s)
5. Create a downstream calibration settings (directories, templates etc.)

**Test the catchment!**

6. Change the settings file of the downstream calibration so that it includes the inflow from upstream

**Test it!**
7. Create initial file for warm start

Cutting the mask map
--------------------

Assuming you have a mask map of the whole catchment (e.g. Yangtze.map and the station points (here Zhutuo 105.75 28.75 and Yichang 111.25 30.75
1. Creating catchment for Zhutuo: catchment 105.75 28.75 ldd_yangtze.map zhu1.map
2. Creating catchment for Yichang: catchment 111.25 30.75 ldd_yangtze.map yi1.map
3. Creating Yichang without Zhutuo::

    pcrcalc a2.map = cover(scalar(zhu1.map)*2,scalar(yi1.map))
    pcrcalc yichang.map = boolean(if(a2.map eq 1,a2.map))

Result is a maskmap: Yichang.map

    :width: 600px

Figure 1: Upstream catchment (blue) and downstream catchment (red)

Detecting the downstream point
------------------------------

The inflow point of the new catchment has to be in the new mask and preferable one grid cell in flow direction below the upstream station e.g. 1 gridcell North East of Zhutuo (see purple circle in fig. 2)

The inflow point has the lon/lat   106.25 29.25

.. image:: _static/cal_tutor2.jpg
    :width: 600px

Figure 2: Downstream point


Run the best calibration scenario upstream 
------------------------------------------

In order to get a long inflow timeserie for the inflow point (here:  Zhutuo)  you need to run the best scenario of the upstream catchment (here: 31_best)

* Change into the folder ../catchments/best
* Change settings file from::

    StepStart = 1/1/1996
    SpinUp = 1/1/2002
    StepEnd =  31/12/2013

* To:: 

    StepStart = 1/1/1990
    SpinUp = 1/1/1996
    StepEnd =  31/12/2013

Results is a time series from 1/1/1990 – 31/12/2013 in: discharge_daily.tss

Create an inflow file from the long timeseries of outlet(s)
-----------------------------------------------------------

* Create a folder ../inflow
* Copy the  ../catchments/31_best/discharge_daily.tss to ../inflow/zhutuo.tss

Create a downstream calibration settings (directories, templates etc.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create downstream calibration settings as before

* Copy everything from upstream catchment (e.g. zhutuo) but not catchments
* Create empty catchments folder
* Create a observed discharge file in observed
* Change settings.txt accordingly
* Change settings.ini accordingly

**Test the catchment setting!**

**But do not create an initial run yet!**

Change the settings file
------------------------
	
Change the settings file of the downstream calibration so that it includes the inflow from upstream
Change the part of the settings.ini::

    [Option]
    inflow = True
    [INFLOW]
    #-------------------------------------------------------
    # if option inflow = true
    # the inflow from outside is added as inflowpoints
    In_Dir = $(FILE_PATHS:PathRoot)/calibration/calibration_yichang/inflow
    # nominal map with locations of (measured)inflow hydrographs [cu m / s]
    InflowPoints = 106.25 29.25
    InLocal = True
    .    
    # if InflowPoints is a map, this flag is to identify if it is global (False) or local (True)
    # observed or simulated input hydrographs as time series [cu m / s]
    # Note: that identifiers in time series have to correspond to InflowPoints
    # can be several timeseries in one file or different files e.g. main.tss mosel.tss
    QInTS = zhutuo.tss

**Test it!**

Generate initial file for warm start
Use initial file for calibration

Joining best sub-basin results to calibration maps
==================================================

1. You need all runs done for all sub-basins
2. A region map

For each subbasin a unique number e.g. Zambezi basin

.. image:: _static/cal_tutor3.jpg
    :width: 600px


Figure 3 Sub-basin map with a unique identifier for each subbasin

3. You need a working PCRaster installation
4. The settings file settings.txt has to be changed::

    [DEFAULT]
    Root = P:/watmodel/CWATM/calibration/calibration_zambezi
    # root directory where all subbasin are in
    .
    [Catchments]
    catch = lukulu, katima, kafue, luangwa, kwando, tete
    # name of the subbasin, has to be the same as the folder name in root
    # the order has to be the same as in the region map
    .
    [region]
    regionmap = P:/watmodel/CWATM/calibration_tutorial/calibration/CreateCalibrationMaps/zambezi_regions.map
    # region map, the order has to be the same a [Catchment]
    .
    [Path]
    Templates = %(Root)s/templates
    SubCatchmentPath = %(Root)s/catchments
    ParamRanges = %(Root)s/Join/ParamRanges.csv
    .
    Result = P:/watmodel/CWATM/calibration_tutorial/calibration/CreateCalibrationMaps/results
    # here are the results
    .
    PCRHOME = C:\PCRaster\bin
    # Where is your PCraster installation?


5. Run python CAL_5_PARAMETER_MAPS.py

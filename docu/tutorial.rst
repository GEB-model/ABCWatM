Requirements
------------

Python version
**************

NEW from 2019 on:
Requirements are a 64 bit `Python 3.7.x version <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/>`_

.. warning:: a 32 bit version is not able to handle the data requirements!

.. warning:: From 2019 on we are changing to Python37. We do not provide further support for Python 2.7

.. warning:: CWATM is tested for Python 3.7 and will for sure not work with Python versions lower than 3.6. We recommend using Python 3.7

Libraries
*********

These external libraries are needed:

* `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
* `Scipy <https://www.scipy.org>`_
* `netCDF4 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netCDF4>`_
* `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org>`_
* `Flopy <https://www.usgs.gov/software/flopy-python-package-creating-running-and-post-processing-modflow-based-models>`_

**Windows**

The five libraries can be installed with pip or
downloaded at `Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs>`_


Windows executeable Python version
**********************************

| The A cwatmexe.zip with all Python libraries and a test case (River Rhine)) is stored on:
| `Source code on Github repository of CWATM <https://github.com/CWatM/CWatM>`_
| `Executable cwatmexe.zip on Github repository of CWATM <https://github.com/CWatM/CWatM/blob/version091/cwatmexe.zip>`_


Test the executable model version
=================================

| Either start cwatm.exe in a DOS box (cmd windows command), or use a batch file e.g. run_test1.bat

Test 1
------

In the root directory cwatm

Please try::

  run run_test1.bat or type .\cwatmexe\cwatm.exe

The output should be like See: :ref:`rst_output1` 


Test 2
------

Please try::

  run run_test2_rhine30min.bat or type .\cwatmexe\cwatm.exe settings_rhine30_test.ini -l

The output should be like See: :ref:`rst_output2` 

.. _rst_output1:

Test the Python model version
=============================

**Windows and Linux** (and maybe Mac, but not tested)

Please try::


   python <modelpath>/run_cwatm.py  (for the Python3.7 version)
   or:
   <modelpath>/cwatm  (for the .exe version)

The output should be::

   Running under platform:  Windows  **(or Linux etc)** 
   CWatM - Community Water Model

   -w --warranty    copyright and warranty information   
	
.. warning:: If python is not set in the environment path, the full path of python has to be used

Error because you did not run it with Python
--------------------------------------------

if the model is causing an error with look like this::

   File "run_cwatm.py", line 116
   print("%-6s %10s %11s\n" %("Step","Date","Discharge"), end=' ')
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

You run the model without the python command in front. Please use: python cwatm.py
(You may have to adjust the path to your python version and to cwatm.py).


Error because the python libraries are installed incorrectly
------------------------------------------------------------

If the model is causing an error at this stage, please check the python libraries::

    python
    import numpy
    import scipy.ndimage
    import gdal
    import netCDF4




Running the model 1
===================


.. warning:: The model needs a settings file as an argument. See: :ref:`rst_settingdoc` 

python <modelpath>/cwatm.py settingsfile flags

example::

   python cwatm.py settings_rhine.ini -l
	
The flag -l show the output on screen as date and discharge 

At this point you should receive this eror message::

   ======================== CWATM FILE ERROR ===========================
   Cannot find option file: d:/work/CWATM/source/metaNetcdf.xml In  "metaNetcdfFile"
   searching: "d:/work/CWATM/source/metaNetcdf.xml"
   path: d:/work/CWATM/source does not exists	


Downloading and installing the spatial dataset 
==============================================

The spatial dataset contains:

* static data ie. data that does not change over time (a model assumption) e.g. soil data
* time dependend (inter annual) data that change periodical during a year e.g. crop coefficient of vegetation
* time dependend (intra annual) data that change by month or year e.g. fraction of landcover

These data are stored as global dataset:

* cwat_input.zip  for the 30' global version
* cwat_input5min.zip  for the 5' global version


As climate data different forcings can be used e.g:

* PGMFD v.2 (Princeton), GSWP3, etc.
* precipitation from e.g. MSWEP http://www.gloh2o.org/
* WATCH+WFDEI  https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/details/5/

and as projection e.g.:

* ISI-MIP dataset https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/#input-data-bias-correction


| For the tutorial we cut out Rhine basin and included the WATCH+WFDEI precipitation, average temperature and the calculated potential evaporation .
| A 30' and a 5' version can be found on FTP in rhine/climate

.. note:: 
   
    | Please copy and unpack the spatial dataset (either 30' or 5')in a folder
    | Please copy the the climate dataset 30min_meteo_rhine.zip or 5min_meteo_rhine.zip in a seperate folder
    | Please create a folder called output

.. note:: 
   
    | For testing purpose there is a file rhine_basin.zip on GitHub
    | it has all the necessary data to run the River Rhine on 30 arcmin from 1990-2010


Changing the Settings file
==========================
	
to run the model the pathes to data have to be set correctly:
The information of pathes are stored in the settings file around line 80-100

[FILE_PATHS]::

    PathRoot = E:/      
    PathOut = $(PathRoot)/output
    PathMaps = E:/cwatm_input
    PathMeteo = E:/climate
    #--------------------------------------
    [NETCDF_ATTRIBUTES]
    institution = IIASA
    title = Global Water Model - WATCH WDFEI
    metaNetcdfFile = $(FILE_PATHS:PathRoot)/CWATM/source/metaNetcdf.xml

.. note:: Please change the pathes according to your file system

.. _rst_output2:

Running the model 2
===================

If you type now::

   python cwatm.py settings_rhine.ini -l



You should see::

   E:\CWATM_rhine\source>python cwatm.py settings_rhine30min.ini -l
   CWATM - Community Water Model  Version: 0.991  Date:  16/09/2017
   International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)
   Running under platform:  Windows
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   CWATM Simulation Information and Setting
   The simulation output as specified in the settings file: settings_rhine30min.ini
   can be found in E:/CWATM_rhine/output
   Step         Date   Discharge
   1      01/01/1961        4.20
   2      02/01/1961        4.23
   ...


If you don't see this. Something went wrong and you might see this instead::

   E:\CWATM_rhine\source>python cwatm.py settings_rhine30min.ini -l
   CWATM - Community Water Model  Version: 0.991  Date:  16/09/2017
   International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)
   Running under platform:  Windows
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   ERROR 4: `E:/CWATM_rhine/cwatm_input/routing/ldd.map' does not exist in the file system,
   and is not recognised as a supported dataset name.
   management_modules.messages.CWATMFileError:
   ======================== CWATM FILE ERROR ===========================
   In  "Ldd"
   searching: "E:/CWATM_rhine/cwatm_input/routing/ldd.map"
   path: E:/CWATM_rhine/cwatm_input/routing does not exists

| The model tries to help you on finding the error.
| In this case it is looking for the river network map ldd.map or ldd.nc or ldd.tif
| but it cannot find the file and not even the path to the file.

Here you might change::

   [FILE_PATHS]
   PathRoot = E:/CWATM_rhine
   PathMaps = $(PathRoot)/cwatm_input

or::

   [TOPOP]
   # local drain direction map (1-9)
   Ldd = $(FILE_PATHS:PathMaps)/routing/ldd.map

But many other error can occure too! Have fun.



Changing parameters of the model
================================

.. note:: An overview of possibilities is given in  see :ref:`rst_settingdoc`


Changing the Output
===================

Output variables
----------------

Output can be every global defined variable in the model
Variable are e.g. Precipitation, runoff, baseflow

but also not so common variables as:

- reservoirStorage (amount of water in the reservoirs in [m3])
- nonIrrReturnFlowFraction (returnflow from domenstic and industrial water use [m3])
- actualET[1] (actual evapotranspiration from grassland [m/day])
- ...

Daily, monthly - at the end or average
--------------------------------------

* per day
* total month, average month, end of month
* total year, average year, end of year 
* total average, total at the end

available prefixes are: 'daily', 'monthtot','monthavg', 'monthend','annualtot','annualavg','annualend','totaltot','totalavg'

for example
::
   
   [OUTPUT]
   # OUTPUT maps and timeseries
   OUT_Dir = $(FILE_PATHS:PathOut)
   OUT_MAP_Daily = discharge, runoff
   OUT_MAP_MonthAvg = Precipitation
   OUT_MAP_TotalEnd = lakeStorage
   OUT_MAP_TotalAvg = Tavg
   
   OUT_TSS_Daily = discharge
   OUT_TSS_AnnualAvg = Precipitation

  
   
.. note:: For each variable the meta data information can be defined in :ref:`rst_metadata`

.. note:: For information how to adjust the output in the settings file see :ref:`rst_outputone`

Time series as point infomation or catchment sum or average
-----------------------------------------------------------

As standard time series can include values of the specific cell as defined in the settings file as *Gauges*
But time series can also show the area sum or area average of the upstream catchment from the specific cell

for example
::
   
   [OUTPUT]
   # OUTPUT maps and timeseries
   # Standard values of a specific cell
   OUT_TSS_Daily = discharge
   OUT_TSS_AnnualAvg = Precipitation
   # Area sum of upstream catchment
   OUT_TSS_AreaSum_MonthTot = Precipitation, runoff
   # Area sum of upstream catchment
   OUT_TSS_AreaAvg_MonthTot = Precipitation


Most important output variables - a selection
---------------------------------------------

::
   
   #Variable name    : Description
   discharge         : river discharge
   runoff            : runoff
   Precipitation     : rainfall + snow
   Tavg              : average temperature
   ETRef: potential  : evaporation from reference soil
   sum_gwRecharge    : total groundwater recharge
   totalET           : total actual evapotranspiration
   baseflow          : baseflow from groundwater
   ... (to be continued)
